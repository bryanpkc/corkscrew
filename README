WELCOME TO CORKSCREW


Introduction

Corkscrew is a tool for tunneling SSH through HTTP proxies, but... you
might find another use for it.

Corkscrew has been compiled on:

-   HPUX
-   Solaris
-   FreeBSD
-   OpenBSD
-   Linux
-   Win32 (with Cygwin)

Corkscrew has been tested with the following HTTP proxies:

-   Gauntlet
-   CacheFlow
-   JunkBuster
-   Apache mod_proxy

Please open a pull request if you get it working on other proxies or
compile it elsewhere.


Where Do I Get It?

Corkscrew's primary distribution site was agroman.net/corkscrew, however
it seems that the site went down and this repository is here to keep the
code available. The new location is then github.com/bryanpkc/corkscrew.


How Do I Install It?

First you need to install development tools:

    # For Debian-based distributions (Ubuntu, ElementaryOS, ...)
    sudo apt install build-essential
    sudo apt-get install -y autoconf

    # For Red-Hat-based distributions (CentOS, Fedora, ...)
    sudo yum groupinstall 'Development tools'

You need to clone the repo and then you need to go into the corkscrew
source directory and run

    autoreconf --install
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install

This will compile corkscrew and copy it into /usr/local/bin/corkscrew.

If you want to go more in depth about the configuration, please have a
look at the INSTALL file which gives general information about the build
system.


How Is It Used?

Setting up Corkscrew with SSH/OpenSSH is very simple. Adding the
following line to your ~/.ssh/config file will usually do the trick
(replace proxy.example.com and 8080 with correct values):

    ProxyCommand /usr/local/bin/corkscrew proxy.example.com 8080 %h %p

NOTE: Command line syntax has changed since version 1.5. Please notice
that the proxy port is NOT optional anymore and is required in the
command line.


How Do I Use The HTTP Authentication Feature?

You will need to create a file that contains your usename and password
in the form of:

    username:password

I suggest you place this file in your ~/.ssh directory.

After creating this file you will need to ensure that the proper perms
are set so nobody else can get your username and password by reading
this file. So do this:

    chmod 600 myauth

Now you will have to change the ProxyCommand line in your ~/.ssh/config
file. Here's an example:

    ProxyCommand /usr/local/bin/corkscrew proxy.work.com 80 %h %p ~/.ssh/myauth

The proxy authentication feature is very new and has not been tested
extensively so your mileage may vary. If you encounter any problems when
trying to use this feature please email me. It would be helpful if you
could include the following information:

-   Proxy version (ie. Gauntlet Proxy, Microsoft Proxy Server, etc)
-   Operating system you are trying to run corkscrew on
-   Command line syntax you are using
-   Any error messages that are visible to you

NOTE: I have had problems using the auth features with Mircosoft Proxy
server. The problems are sporadic, and I believe that they are related
to the round-robin setup that I was testing it again. Your mileage may
vary.


Who Contributed?

The main author is Pat Padgett. But none of the contact info left work
anymore, so a name is all we have.

Bryan Chan created this repository and tweaked the code a little bit.
Then RÃ©my Sanchez improved the documentation.
